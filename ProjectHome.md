Molengo is a Latin typeface for documents.
It is multilingual and has some features required by many minority languages such as non-spacing mark placement.

The font is produced with Fontforge.
The glyphs are designed in a CFF file but the production file is a TTF file with hinting instructions made with Xgridfit.

The files are released under the OFL license (see http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
To generate the font from the source files you'll need Fontforge (http://fontforge.sourceforge.net/) and Xgridfit (http://xgridfit.sourceforge.net/).
